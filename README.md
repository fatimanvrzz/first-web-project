#  My First Web Project

This is my **first web project**, built as a training exercise. Through this project, I learned how to use **Tailwind CSS** and **TypeScript** within a React + Vite setup.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Vite**

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

This is my **first time using Tailwind CSS**, and I was able to make the project work well on **mobile devices**.  
However, the **desktop responsiveness** is not fully implemented yet.  
This is something I plan to improve in future versions.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

- A simple **landing page** layout
- Styled with **Tailwind utility classes**
- Contains basic **sections** similar to a product or service presentation page
- All components written in **TypeScript**

## ðŸ“ˆ What I Learned

- Setting up a React project using **Vite**
- Writing and styling components with **Tailwind CSS**
- Using **TypeScript** in a frontend project
- Basic project structure and component organization

## ðŸ”§ Future Improvements

- Add full **responsive design** for larger screens (tablet & desktop)
- Improve **code structure**
- Add **animations** and **interactivity**
- Deploy the site publicly (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
